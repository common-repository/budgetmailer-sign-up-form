== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I use the shortcode? =

The simplest use is to paste the shortcode "[budgetmailer_subscribe]" to any page or post.

The shortcode has a lot of optional arguments. Here is the full example:

[budgetmailer_subscribe t="My form title" e="Email label" cl="Company Name Label" cd=1 cr=1 fnl="First Name label" fnd=1 fnr=1 mnl="Middle Name label" mnd=1 mnr=0 lnl="Last name label" lnd=1 lnr=1 sel="Sex Label" sed=1 ser=1 tel="Telephone Label" ted=1 ter=1 mol="Mobile Label" mod=1 mor=1 adl="Address Label" add=1 adr=1 zil="ZIP Label" zid=1 zir=1 cil="City Label" cid=1 cir=1 col="Country Label" cod=1 cor=1 sl="Submit Button Label" hb="Text before form" ha="Text after form" mi="Invalid field warning" mif="Invalid form warning" ms="Success message" me="Error message"]

Meaning of all the attributes:

* t: Title
* e: Email field label
* cl: Company label
* cd: Company displayed
* cr: Company required
* fnl: First name field label
* fnd: First name displayed
* fnr: First name required
* mnl: Middle name field label
* mnd: Middle name displayed
* mnr: Middle name required
* lnl: Last name label
* lnd: Last name displayed
* lnr: Last name required
* sel: Sex field label
* sed: Sex displayed
* ser: Sex required
* tel: Telephone field label
* ted: Telephone displayed
* ter: Telephone required
* mol: Mobile field label
* mod: Mobile displayed
* mor: Mobile required
* adl: Address field label
* add: Address displayed
* adr: Address required
* cil: City field label
* cid: City displayed
* cir: City required
* col: Country field label
* cod: Country displayed
* cor: Country required
* sl: Submit button label
* hb: Text before form (HTML not supported)
* ha: Text after form (HTML not supported)
* mi: Invalid field error message
* mif: Invalid form error message
* ms: Sign-up successful message
* me: Sign-up failed Message

To configure the shortcode more easily, you can also use the widget (see "How do I create a shortcode with a widget?").

= How do I display the Widget? =

* Go to WordPress administration "Appearance>Widgets" and find "BudgetMailer Sign Up Form Widget"
* Drag it to any widget container you want
* Configure the options in the Widget Settings Form

= How do I create a shortcode with a widget? =

Because of all the attributes, using the shortcode can be quite complicated. We therefore made it possible to create a shortcode using the widget configuration.

If you create and configure any BudgetMailer widget, at the end of the form you will find a unique shortcode. With this shortcode, you can display the sign up form at every page or post.

If you don't want to display the widget itself, configure it in "Inactive Widgets" area.
